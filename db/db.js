					"Fossiltech is a Minecraft modpack/dedicated server experience that I have created as a game overhaul of Minecraft. The gameloop involves mining for fossils and genetically engineering the extracted DNA from the fossils to create living dinosaurs, which are then taken care of in a jurrasic park-style system by the player. I created a suite of proprietary client and server-side features using Forge API 1.12.2, and SpongeAPI 7 in Java, alongside graphical and literary marketing material to promote the modpack. The server has approx. 2,400+ unique logins as of 08/03/2022 - full-scale marketing is yet to take place.",
