					"A Game Jam project I took and developed further in my own time. Cabin of Creepy Crawlies is a 16 bit Roguelike puzzle game where you have to navigate the Cabin, whilst simulatneously dodging the various enemies introduced during the levels. A simple premise but provided to be good practice for level design and 2D tile mapping - I am currently still working on this project to further develop my level design skills. For this project I worked on player movement and level design including the layout of the prototype levels for testing to ensure the enemies all provided a new level of difficulty to the game.",

				summary:
				"Labyrinth is a 2D pixel art top-down dungeon crawler for PS4 using a fully-proprietary data-driven 2D engine and renderer that has been built from scratch. This project includes more complex algorithms such as bi-directional A* pathfinding, enemy AI behaviour trees, entity component systems, real-time collisions, and other low-level engine features. The player can choose between a melee class and a ranged class which come with their own unique attacks and abilities. They can also customise their character's appearance by choosing one of 9 skins. The game itself follows the player through 4 uniquely designed levels depicting the floors of a castle, battling goblins along the way, ending in a labyrinth and a Minotaur boss. My biggest contribution to the game was the behaviour tree AI, ",

				summary:
					"My 2nd year university project, Temple of The Sun. I was in charge of Game Design and making sure the group worked together well. We decided to go for a mirrors edge meets tomb raider style with some basic parkour elements and platforming inside of an ancient temple. The game consists of 3 levels, with your time being your score with a fully functioning leaderboard that updates if you complete the game. Level 1 is mainly jumping puzzles without any of the parkour elements. Level 2 requires the player to notice patterns on the floor to save them from their demise along with some wall climbing using the E key and finally, level 3 is a parkour level that consists of wall running, climbing and jumping to get to the end of the game.",

				summary:
					"This is a group university project called Brum Brum. Our goal was a top down vehicular shooter, we were advised to create a space invaders clone but I didn’t want to settle for that so I lead my team into designing a post apocalyptic top down racing game with shooter elements. We were inspired by Micro Machines and the Mad Max franchise to create the look and feel for our game. The player controls the car by aiming where they would like the car to go with the cursor, they can click to shoot enemy vehicles – killing these takes time off the clock so you can achieve a better score! The small enemy cars keep respawning until lap 2, where a hovering boss truck spawns and the player can eventually kill this boss too – granting a much greater time reduction. The enemies can deploy barrels to slow down the player and we have a catch-up mechanic implemented so they don’t just race off. During production of our game, I worked on the camera and player controls including; driving, shooting and interacting with the environment. ",
